#User level agg 2

'''
This is the final aggregation step tp create the user journey which comprises all marketing channels that a user has been through and whether or not that user has converted. 

For each marketing channel subset, weâ€™ll find out how many conversions (conv_1_life column) and non-conversions (total_null column) has been derived from that channel. 

The result of the script would be stored in a BigQuery table named mta_data_agg_2. 

This step is optional since we have done this aggregation in Jupyter notebooks also for quick analysis through pandas.
